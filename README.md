My config compatible with both vim and neovim.

- LSP supported
- Around 60 packages
- Developped over the years
- A mix of lua and vimscript (because vimscript is more handy for a lot of things including mapping and sometimes lua is necessary)
- Quite documented

My config is public to make it easier for me to install and share it.

Install.sh creates symbolic links to this folder and install Plug ((n)vim package manager) and install all packages.

# Todo
- A command to warn when the git repo is out of sync
