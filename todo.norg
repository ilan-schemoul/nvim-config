* GHT

  - ( ) Prio 1
  -- ( ) Auto install
  -- ( ) Auto update
  - ( ) Prio 2
  -- ( ) release package with list of package and version
  -- ( ) synchronise via git list of dependencies
  -- ( ) if name not found search popular package


* Neovim

** Very important
   Also check {:/home/ilan/notes/technical_todo:} if at work
   Also check other sections (like LSP and Plugins) below

   -- ( ) super CPU expensive to get name of branch. Maybe just get current branch every 5s. And others every 60s ?
   -- (!) Intersec related
   --- ( ) Import things from /srv/tools/../vim fold and others
   -- ( ) find something less shitty than Obsession which keeps not saving my tabs
** Somewhat important
   -- ( ) DAP
   -- ( ) Fix define in libs when opened neovim
   -- ( ) Not vim: try https://github.com/tummychow/git-absorb
** Not urgent at all
   -- ( ) Create a YAML config system for neovim
   -- ( ) Add shortcut to open code in gerrit
   -- ( ) gx should open in regex101 when I underline regex
   -- ( ) Add azerty to key-analyzer
   -- ( ) Find a refactoring plugin that works

** Lsp/formating
   -- ( ) Clang-format
   --- ( ) Detect single line comments (forbidden)
   --- ( ) || end of line if "if" multiple lines
   @code
   if (test1 && test2 &&
   (test3 || test4 ||
   test5))
   {
   @end
   --- ( ) Detect struct when not necessary because typdef (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/91063) (not clang-format according to someone)
   --- ( ) Fix "q_m(t) * e" (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/91062)
   --- ( ) Newline after declarations (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/91064)

* Plugins creation ideas/contributions
  -- (!) !! plugin to show the diff between the code NOW and last moment where code compiled/tests passed
  -- ( ) (lazygit) fix when you modify a commit then scroll up or down then modify second commit and press enter. The commits
         are much broken
  - ( ) Ability to search synonyms (e.g: delete also search remove etc.).
  - (maybe in core) check if keymap exists natively
  -- Experiment: mark something in undo list with a mark so if experiment fail you can go back to that time
     when experiment is over
  -- Warn if options passed to lazy does not exist (setup instead of config etc.)
  - (core) Ctrl-i/Ctrl-o but inside same file
